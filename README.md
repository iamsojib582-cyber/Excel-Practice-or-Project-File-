# Netflix Content Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project uses a dataset of Netflix movies and TV shows to identify trends in content production and audience preferences. I transformed raw data into an interactive dashboard to make the information easy to understand.

## Objectives
* Analyze the ratio of Movies vs. TV Shows.
* Identify the most popular genres on the platform.
* Visualize the growth of Netflix content over the last 10 years.

## Tools Used
* **Excel Power Query:** Used for data cleaning (removing duplicates and handling missing "Rating" values).
* **Pivot Tables:** Used to summarize 8,000+ rows of data.
* **Pivot Charts & Slicers:** Created an interactive dashboard that allows users to filter by "Country" and "Type."
* 
## Key Insights
1. **Content Mix:** Movies make up roughly 70% of the platform's content compared to TV Shows.
2. **Growth Trend:** There was a massive spike in content added between 2016 and 2019.
3. **Top Genre:** International Movies and Dramas are the most frequent categories.

## How to Use
1. Download the `Netflix_Project.xlsx` file from this repository.
2. Open it in Excel.
3. Use the **Slicers** (buttons) on the Dashboard sheet to interact with the charts.
